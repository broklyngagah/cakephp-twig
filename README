CakePHP 2 compatable TwigView class. Very broken ATM. I am stepping this one up to >= PHP 5.3.0 only.

Plans:
	
	* Custom Twig FileLoader to take advantage of CakePHP layout conventions:	
		{% extends 'Plugin.LayoutFileName' %}
		or
		{% extends 'App.LayoutFileName' %}
	* Don't rely on CakePHP's 2-pass rendering, rely on extends/blocks exclusively.
	* Try to be compatible with ctp rendering? Not sure ATM.
	* Make it fast, fast, fast.
	
Notes:
	
	* Check compatability with "themed" - http://book.cakephp.org/2.0/en/views/themes.html
	* Add a layer of cache for template paths, or rely on CakePHP's built-in?
